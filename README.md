Node-CSV-tool
=============

Uses Node to Parse CSV files and merge them on a shared key.


This tool is using node to load file CSV files into a buffer so they can be joined on a shared key.

Promises are used to handle when the files are finish loading asynchronously.

All the file names are entered in the command line are additional arguments and the shared key is the last argument.
